Flavor profiles for a blind whiskey tasting, according to all participants

A fun personal project inspired by a blind whisky tasting. I collected all the participants' handwritten notes and inputted them into a CSV. Using the host company's tasting wheel, I tagged each note with a flavor profile and made each whisky's individual tasting wheel according to the participants. I also attempted to match flavor profiles and guess price range. A small but satisfying project.
